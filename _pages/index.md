Welcome to my website!

***

I am Alex Taye, a recent Ph.D. graduate and currently on the job market. Before that, I was a doctoral researcher in Economics at the <a href="https://wwwen.uni.lu/fdef/department_of_economics_and_management/"> University of Luxembourg</a> (Department of Economics and Management) in Data-driven Computational Modelling and Applications <a href="https://driven.uni.lu/team/"> (DRIVEN)</a> research team.
<br>
<br>
My main research interest lies in the field of applied microeconomics, poverty, labour economics, and the intersection of machine learning and microeconometrics.
<br>
<br>
I worked extensively on topics such as predicting vulnerability to poverty, material and social deprivations and protective behaviours during a health crisis. I use cutting-edge machine learning algorithms augmented with state-of-the-art model
interpretative tools and causal analysis to improve our theoretical understanding of complex social phenomena.
<br>
<br>
Prior to commencing my postgraduate studies, I worked as an Assistant Research Officer in the Economic Modeling and Statistical Analysis Department at the Central Bank of Ethiopia.

Outside of my research, I enjoy painting and photography, which help me to maintain a healthy work-life balance. I also believe in the importance of giving back to the community, and I have volunteered with [insert the organizations with which you have volunteered].
