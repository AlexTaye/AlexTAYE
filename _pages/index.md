Welcome to my homepage!

***

I am a PhD candidate in Economics (expected date of defence: March 2023) at the <a href="https://wwwen.uni.lu/fdef/department_of_economics_and_management/"> University of Luxembourg</a> (Department of Economics and Management) in Data-driven Computational Modelling and Applications <a href="https://driven.uni.lu/team/"> (DRIVEN)</a> research team.
<br>
<br>
My main research interest lies in the field of applied microeconomics, poverty, labour economics, and the intersection of machine learning and microeconometrics.
<br>
<br>
I worked extensively on topics such as predicting vulnerability to poverty, material and social deprivations and protective behaviours during health crisis. I use cutting-edge machine learning algorithms augmented with state-of-the-art model
interpretative tools and causal analysis to improve our theoretical understanding of complex social phenomena.
<br>
<br>
Prior to commencing my Postgraduate studies, I worked as an Assistant Research Officer in the Economic Modeling and Statistical Analysis Department at the Central Bank of Ethiopia.

### My research interests are:
- Well-posedness of nonlinear and nonlocal/fractional evolutionary PDEs.
- Long-time behavior and regularity of solutions to PDEs.
- Numerical analysis of PDEs.
- Applications of PDEs, e.g., in nonlinear acoustics, fluid dynamics, and tumor growth modeling (corresponding to the images on the right hand side from top to bottom, respectively).

### Other notes:
- I still do finite element research! In fact, I'm an active [MFEM](https://mfem.org/) developer. Check out our (growing) list of examples codes and miniapps [here](https://mfem.org/examples/).
- This website has been tidied up a little bit. If you are interested in my old finite element work (2015-2020), short summaries can still be found [here](/research/).<br> -->
